summary: "Scaffold packages/knowledge-store with KnowledgeStorePort, Drizzle-backed knowledge tables in db-schema/knowledge, and seed data for the first Polymarket strategy and prompt. Unblocks task.0227's poly-synth graph."
outcome: "Analysis graphs read strategy + prompt content from a typed port instead of hardcoded strings. Knowledge tables exist in Postgres. Poly strategy seed data is queryable. Port abstraction enables future Dolt migration without consumer changes."

# Knowledge Data Plane — Port, Schema, Drizzle Adapter, Poly Seeds

> Spec: [knowledge-data-plane](../../docs/spec/knowledge-data-plane.md) | Project: [proj.poly-prediction-bot](../projects/proj.poly-prediction-bot.md)

## Context

The monitoring-engine spec defines an **awareness plane** (Postgres): observations, triggers, signals, outcomes — what the AI sees and decides right now.

The knowledge-data-plane spec defines a **knowledge plane**: strategies, prompts, evaluations, evidence, playbooks, claims — what the AI has learned over time.

Task.0227's `poly-synth` analysis graph needs to read strategy content and system prompts. Currently these would be hardcoded. This task gives them a proper home behind a typed port.

### Relationship to prior knowledge-store work

Branch `docs/spike-0137-knowledge-store` designed a Postgres-based knowledge store (entities, relations, observations). This task uses the same Postgres approach but with a **simpler schema** focused on strategy/prompt versioning (the immediate need), not entity resolution. The spec targets Dolt as the v1 backend — the port abstraction makes that a transparent adapter swap.

## Design

### Outcome

Analysis graphs read strategy and prompt content from `KnowledgeStorePort` instead of hardcoded strings. Knowledge accumulates in typed, versioned tables.

### Approach

**Solution**: Postgres knowledge tables behind a port abstraction, following existing Drizzle + db-schema patterns. One new capability package (`packages/knowledge-store/`), one new db-schema file (`packages/db-schema/src/knowledge.ts`).

**Reuses**:

- Existing Postgres infrastructure (zero new services)
- Existing Drizzle ORM + migration tooling
- Existing `@cogni/db-client` factory pattern
- Existing `@cogni/db-schema` slice pattern (same as attribution)
- Existing testcontainer setup for Postgres
- Existing capability package shape (port + domain + adapters)

**Rejected**:

- **Dolt from day 1** — adds second database engine (MySQL-compatible), second driver (mysql2), raw SQL migrations (no Drizzle), new testcontainer setup, new docker-compose service. None of these exist in the codebase today. The unique Dolt features (branching, fork inheritance, cross-node sharing) aren't exercised until Walk phase. Port abstraction means we can swap to Dolt later without changing consumers. (**REJECT_COMPLEXITY**)
- **Knowledge tables in `db-schema/ingestion`** — knowledge is a different concern from awareness data. Wrong slice boundary.
- **No knowledge store / hardcoded strategies** — creates tech debt in task.0227. Every domain pack would hardcode its own strategy+prompt content with no versioning.
- **Full entity/relation/observation model (proj.knowledge-store)** — over-engineered for the immediate need. Strategy + prompt versioning is the 80/20. Entity resolution and claims layer are Walk concerns.

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] AWARENESS_HOT_KNOWLEDGE_COLD: Knowledge tables are separate from awareness tables (spec: knowledge-data-plane)
- [ ] PORT_BEFORE_BACKEND: All access via `KnowledgeStorePort`, not direct Drizzle queries (spec: knowledge-data-plane)
- [ ] KNOWLEDGE_SOVEREIGN_BY_DEFAULT: Node knowledge is local/private by default; sharing is explicit (spec: knowledge-data-plane)
- [ ] SCHEMA_GENERIC_CONTENT_SPECIFIC: Domain specificity in `domain` column + `params` JSONB, not table structure (spec: knowledge-data-plane)
- [ ] NO_PACKAGES_TO_SRC: Package cannot import from `src/**` (spec: architecture)
- [ ] PACKAGES_BUILD_BEFORE_APP: Package builds before Next.js app (spec: build-architecture)
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION: Leverages existing Postgres/Drizzle/db-client patterns — zero new infrastructure
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT: Capability package shape (port + domain + adapters) per existing packages

### Files

**Create:**

- `packages/db-schema/src/knowledge.ts` — Drizzle table definitions (flat file, matches existing pattern: `attribution.ts`, `billing.ts`, etc.). Tables: `strategies`, `strategyVersions`, `strategyEvaluations`, `promptDefs`, `promptVersions`. (`playbooks`, `evidenceRefs`, `knowledgeClaims` deferred — no producer/consumer in Crawl)
- `packages/knowledge-store/src/port/knowledge-store.port.ts` — `KnowledgeStorePort` interface
- `packages/knowledge-store/src/domain/schemas.ts` — Zod schemas for knowledge types
- `packages/knowledge-store/src/adapters/drizzle.adapter.ts` — `DrizzleKnowledgeStoreAdapter`
- `packages/knowledge-store/src/index.ts` — barrel export (port + domain)
- `packages/knowledge-store/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`
- `packages/knowledge-store/AGENTS.md`
- `packages/knowledge-store/tests/` — unit tests (schemas), contract tests (adapter vs Postgres)

**Modify:**

- `packages/db-schema/src/index.ts` — add knowledge slice re-export
- `packages/db-schema/package.json` — add `@cogni/db-schema/knowledge` subpath export
- `package.json` (root) — add `@cogni/knowledge-store` workspace dependency
- `tsconfig.json` (root) — add reference
- Drizzle migration — new tables

**Seed:**

- Initial `prediction-market` strategy ("Calibrated Market Analyst")
- Initial `poly-synth-prompt` prompt definition + v1 with system prompt text

- Full awareness pipeline (task.0227)
- Automatic promotion gate (manual promotion only)
- pgvector / semantic search
- Multi-node knowledge sharing
- UI for knowledge browsing
- `analysis_runs.knowledge_version` column (added when task.0227 wires analysis runs)
